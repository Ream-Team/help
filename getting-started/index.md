# Getting Started

This page describes how to get started on a new project and how to edit your profile.

## Import from Overleaf

First, go to your Overleaf account and download the projects of interest. You can do this individually by clicking on the "Download" icon on the project's row.

You should then get a .zip file in your Downloads directory containing your projects. Navigate to Ream and click on the `New Project` button.
