# Getting Started with Ream

Ream is a platform designed to make academic writing easier. This guide will walk you through creating your first project in Ream.

## Creating a New Project

When you first log into Ream, you'll be presented with a welcome screen that invites you to create your first project.

To begin, click the "New Project" button. You'll be presented with two options:

1. Import an existing project
2. Create a new project from scratch

### Importing Projects

If you have existing projects, you can import them by compressing your files (.zip or .tar.gz) and uploading them through the import interface.

The import feature supports:
- Single compressed projects (containing .tex, .bib, and other files)
- Multiple compressed projects (as a zipped folder of .zip files)

Files up to 50MB are supported, and Ream will automatically detect and handle the upload type appropriately.

### Creating a New Project

To start fresh, select "Create a New Project" and you'll see a project setup form.
