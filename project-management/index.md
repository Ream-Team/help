# Managing Projects

## Project Views and Organization

The project management interface consists of two main sections:

1. **Recently Viewed** - Displays up to four of your most recently accessed projects
2. **My Projects** - Contains your complete project list with pagination support

### Project Status Categories

The My Projects section offers four filtering options:

- All
- In Progress
- Completed 
- Collaborations

Project status (In Progress/Completed) is determined by settings within the Editor View. The Collaborations filter shows projects with added collaborators.
