# Assistant

This page describes how to set up and use Ream Assistant.

## Set up

We are still rapidly iterating on the app and experimenting with different pricing models. Until then, AI features can be accessed directly via an Anthropic API token. Note: this means that you will be charged by Anthropic for usage. To better understand their pricing structure, please check out [this page](https://www.anthropic.com/pricing#anthropic-api) (we are using Claude 3.5 Sonnet).

### What's an "Anthropic API token"?

Ream Assistant is currently powered by Anthropic's [Claude language models](https://www.anthropic.com/claude) due to their strong LaTeX expertise and low latency responses.

### Getting an Anthropic API token

First, create an Anthropic account [here.](https://console.anthropic.com/login?returnTo=%2F%3F).
