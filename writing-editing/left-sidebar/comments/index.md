# Comments (Annotations and Suggestions)

The editor provides comprehensive commenting capabilities similar to Google Docs, allowing users to add, manage, and resolve comments at both file and selection levels.

## Comment Types

### File-Level Comments
When no text is selected in the editor or when viewing a static file, users can add comments that apply to the entire file. These comments appear in the Comments sidebar on the left.

### Selection-Based Comments
Users can add comments to specific selections of text within the editor. When adding a comment to selected text, the selection context is preserved and displayed along with the comment in the sidebar.

## Managing Comments

The Comments sidebar provides several options for managing comments:

### Basic Actions
- **Add Comment**: Click the "Add Comment to File" button or select text and add a comment
- **Reply**: Use the reply box below any comment to add responses
- **Resolve**: Click the checkmark to resolve a comment
- **Edit/Delete**: Access additional options via the ellipsis (...) menu next to each comment

### Advanced Features
- **View Resolved Comments**: Access previously resolved comments by clicking "View Resolved Annotations" in the bottom left
- **Suggestions Mode**: The editor supports a suggestions mode that allows tracking proposed changes:
  - Changes made in suggestion mode appear alongside regular comments
  - Both AI-generated and human suggestions are displayed uniformly in the comments interface
  - Users can review and manage suggestions similar to regular comments

## Comment Organization
- Active comments appear in the main Comments sidebar
- Resolved comments are automatically moved to the Resolved Annotations section
- Comments maintain context by displaying the original selection when applicable

## Best Practices
- Use file-level comments for general feedback or notes about the entire document
- Use selection-based comments for specific feedback about particular sections or elements
- Resolve comments once they've been addressed to keep the sidebar organized
- Utilize the suggestions mode when proposing specific text changes
